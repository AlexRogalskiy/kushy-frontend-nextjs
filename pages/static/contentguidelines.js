            <h4>Respect</h4>
            <p>Everyone is an equal here, to elevate society we all should refrain from threats, harassment, hate speech, discrimination, and any other form of belittlement.</p>
            <h4>Keep it Legal</h4>
            <p>If it’s not legal where you’re at, it’s probably not legal to do on our website. We ask that everyone observe all local and federal legislation each action on the website — from purchasing pot to posting pictures of it, the legality of things varies immensely in every location. Don’t ask other users if they’ll sell you weed, only purchase from verified businesses that are permitted by local law to distribute cannabis.</p>
            <h4>Privacy</h4>
            <p>Please respect everyone’s privacy. Don’t post any private information or close-up photos of people without their permission. When posting people’s names, don’t refer to them by their full name unless commonly referred by it.</p>
            <h4>Copyright</h4>
            <p>Don’t steal content from other users. If it’s not your photo or video, give the original creator credit for their work. If it’s not your review, don’t post it, period.</p>
            <h4>Extortion</h4>
            <p>Asking for money in exchange for reviews isn’t cool, whether you’re asking for a refund or payment for a 5-star phonie. If you received help and have changed your mind, feel free to edit your old review or make a new one. </p>

          <h2 class="ui header">Business Guidelines:</h2>
          <section class="ui segment">
            <h4>Profile Page</h4>
            <p>Use your profile to let the world know about your business and all the awesome things you’re doing. Don’t add batches of keywords, false statements, or any other methods intending to abuse SEO.</p>

            <h4>Customer Interaction</h4>
            <p>We’ve found that the best practice is to direct message any customer that has a issue or dispute with your business, while also leaving a public comment to acknowledge your private message. Please make all direct messages clear and concise. Please don’t post public or direct messages that personally attack consumers, advertise, or incentivize review changes.</p>

            <h4>Copyright</h4>
            <p>Please don’t post pictures, videos, or content you don’t have rights to. Unless you made it, it’s stock, or you’ve purchased the rights - it’s probably not right to post it.</p>

            <h4>Payment for Reviews</h4>
            <p>Feel free to ask your customers to review their experience on our website, just please don’t pay or offer compensation for any reviews. Customers these days are smart, and can sniff out fake reviews from a mile away. </p>

            <h4>Events</h4>
            <p>Hosting a hot event or patient appreciation day? Post it up in our event calendar! If it’s a sale, coupon, or similar one-time or recurring promotion - please use the coupon or business description to announce it.</p>
